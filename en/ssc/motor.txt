#h Motor seizure
Seizures in which the main symptomatology is motor are identified as motor seizures.

#u Two major subgroups can be differentiated:
- Simple motor seizures in which the motor movements are relatively "simple," unnatural, and consist of movements similar to movements elicited by electrical stimulation of the primary motor areas (Brodmann areas 4 and 6).
- Complex motor seizures, in which the movements are relatively complex and simulate natural movements, except that they are inappropriate for the situation.

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial

#hh Note:
Bilateral asymmetric means that the symptoms occurred in a bilateral distribution but had a significant degree of asymmetry. The term suggests that the patient has a focal epilepsy. The modifier generalized is used when the manifestations occur in a relatively widespread distribution and there is approximately equal involvement of both sides and of the distal and proximal segments. The modifier "axial" is used when the manifestations involve predominantly the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the extremities. Usually patients who have axial or generalized seizures have generalized epilepsy. However, some patients with focal epilepsy may have axial or generalized seizures and, vice versa, patients with generalized epilepsies may have seizures that include significant focal elements.
