#h Paroxysmal event
Paroxysmal events are episodes in which the observer believes that there is not sufficient evidence to assume that a “seizure-like” event was of epileptic nature.

If an “ictal” EEG is available, it should not show an ictal EEG pattern. This classification of epileptic seizures is based exclusively on semiology. However, the EEG can be used to determine whether an episode is epileptic or not. Episodes for which there is not sufficient proof of epileptic nature are classified merely as paroxysmal events.

#u Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures may express typical signs:
- Longer duration, often longer than ten minutes.
- Situation-related.
- Asynchronneous, irregular jerks lacking typical evolution.
- Non stereotyped.
- No posturing.
- Preserved response to stimuli while consciousness is grossly impaired. Eyes closed, active resistance with passive opening.
- Not originating from sleep, hower may start from pseudosleep.
