#h Hypermotor seizure
Hypermotor seizures are seizures in which the main manifestations consist of complex movements involving the proximal segments of the limbs and trunk. This results in large movements that appear "violent" when they occur at high speeds.

The "complex motor manifestations" imitate normal movements, but the movements are inappropriate for the situation and usually serve no purpose. Frequently, the movements are stereotypically repeated in more or less complex sequences (e.g., pedaling). Consciousness may be preserved during these seizures. Duration of hypermotor seizures is usally less than one minute. Hypermotor seizures often reflect epileptic activiation of anterior cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex. Ictal EEG pattern may be completely obscured with movement and muslce artifacts. In combination with normal interictal EEG finding and preserved consciousness hypermotor seizures may be misdiagnosed as psychogenic nonepileptic events.

#u Use the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:
- Left hemispheric
- Right hemispheric
- Speech dominant
- Speech non-dominant
