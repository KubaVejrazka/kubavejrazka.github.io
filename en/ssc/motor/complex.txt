#h Complex motor seizure
Complex motor seizures are characterised by movements which are relatively complex and simulate natural movements, except that they are inappropriate for the situation.

The following three types of complex motor seizures can be distinguished. Again, "complex" herein refers to the complex characteristics of the movement and does not mean that the patient loses awareness during the seizure.

#u Use the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:
- Left hemispheric
- Right hemispheric
- Speech dominant
- Speech non-dominant
