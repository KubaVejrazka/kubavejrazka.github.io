#h Gelastic seizure
Seizures in which the main motor manifestation is "laughing" are termed gelastic seizures.

They may be preceded or followed by any other type of seizure. Only seizures in which the main ictal semiology is laughing should be classified as gelastic seizures. The „laugh“ in gelastic seizures is usually unnatural and inappropriate for the situation. These seizures are classified separately because they are common in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma.
