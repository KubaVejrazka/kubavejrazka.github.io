#h Myoclonic seizure
Myoclonic seizures consist of short muscle contractions lasting <400 ms.

Bilateral or unilateral involvement of different muscle groups may predominate. Generalized myoclonic seizures occur in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome - patients typically have also other types of seizures, e.g. tonic, dialeptic, astatic, generalized tonic-clonic. Generalized myoclonic seizures affecting predominantly arms and proximal parts of upper extremities are typically seen in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial
