#h Epileptic spasm
The term epileptic spasm is used to identify muscle contractions of variable duration which affect predominantly axial muscles.

Epileptic spasms frequently occur in clusters in which the duration of the muscle contractions may vary from a short myoclonic jerk to a sustained tonic posturing. Usually the epileptic spasm consists of abduction of both arms in a “salaam” posture. Epileptic spasms are the typical seizure type of children with West syndrome where they have specific EEG ictal pattern characterised by electrodecrement at the background of interictal hypsarrythmia.

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial
