#h Autonomic aura
Autonomic alterations elicited by epileptic activation of autonomic cortical centers produce symptoms that the patient can detect but that observers have difficulty identifying.

Autonomic alterations produce symptoms that the patient can detect but that observers have difficulty identifying, particularly from a videotape recording (palpitations, hot flashes, and so on). Sensations that most probably are an expression of an epileptic autonomic alteration are classified as autonomic auras even when there is no objective proof of their autonomic pathogenesis (such as palpitations or hot flashes). In contrast, autonomic alterations appropriately documented by polygraphic recordings (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and so on) or direct visual observation (mydriasis, sweating, flushing, piloerection, and so on) are classified as autonomic seizures. Isolated autonomic alterations may result from epileptic activation of frontobasal cortex or anterior part of cingulate gyrus.

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial
