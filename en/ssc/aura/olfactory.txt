#h Olfactory aura
Perception of a smell as an epileptic phenomenon is classified as an olfactory aura.

Olfactory auras are not so common. They are usually described as a strange unpleasant smell - uncinate crisis. At times, like auditory and visual hallucinations and illusions, they are associated with other complex alterations of perception. These complex alterations of perception should be classified as psychic auras unless the olfactory aura is clearly the predominant feature. Olfactory aura is probably the result of epileptic activation close to gyrus rectus.
