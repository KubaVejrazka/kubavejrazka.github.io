#h Psychic aura
Psychic auras consist of complex hallucinations and illusions that usually affect different senses.

The most typical examples are distortions of familiarity, such as sensations of d√©ja vu or jamais vu. Frequently these sensations may be associated with emotional alterations, such as fear. In addition, they may occur together with complex visual, auditory or other hallucinations and illusions, including visual hallucinations such as macropsia, micropsia, and so on. Psychic auras result probably from the activation of temporal association neocortex.
