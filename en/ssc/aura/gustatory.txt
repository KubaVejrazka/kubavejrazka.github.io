#h Gustatory aura
Perception of a taste as an epileptic phenomenon is classified as a gustatory aura.

Gustatory auras are usually described as a taste that is difficult to describe and may be unpleasant. These auras also tend to be associated with complex perceptual alterations. The term gustatory aura should be applied only when the gustatory hallucination is the predominant symptom. Gustatory aura is probably the result of epileptic activation in posterior part of the insula.
