#h Typical dialeptic seizure
Typical dialeptic seizures consist of short episodes of altered consciousness: <20 s. The alteration of consciousness begins and ends abruptly and frequently is associated with rhythmical eye blinking at a rate of ~ 3 Hz.

Patients with generalized absence epilepsy often have typical dialeptic seizures. All seizures that consist mainly of an alteration of consciousness but that are not “typical dialeptic seizures” should be classified as just dialeptic seizures.

#u Use the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:
- Left hemispheric
- Right hemispheric
- Speech dominant
- Speech non-dominant
