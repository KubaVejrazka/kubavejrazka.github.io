#h Negative myoclonic seizure
Negative myoclonic seizures are seizures that consist of a brief interruption of tonic muscle activity due to an epileptiform discharge.

The brief interruption of muscle activity may result in a short, sudden movement similar to a myoclonic jerk. However, the pathogenesis of the movement is a brief loss of muscle tone and not a burst of muscle potentials characteristic of myoclonic seizures. Evidence suggests that these seizures are generated by epileptiform discharges in the primary sensorimotor cortex.

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial
