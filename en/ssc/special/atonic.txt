#h Atonic seizure
Atonic seizures cause a loss of postural tone which may affect the head, the whole body or part of the body.

The result is loss of posture (head drops, falls, and so on). Often these seizures are preceded by a short myoclonic seizure causing propulsion or retropulsion of the body and patients then suffer more injuries due to their falls compared to simple atonic falls. Atonic seizures are usually generalized, however focal atonic seizures with involvement of only part of the body were also described as "ictal paresis" or "inhibitory seizure". Atonic seizures probably reset from epileptic activition of cortical negative motor area or form activation of inhibitory centers in brainstem; e.g. gigantocellular nucleus

#u Somatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:
- Left
- Right
- For seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)
- Bilateral asymmetric
- Generalized
- Axial

#hh Note:
Bilateral asymmetric means that the symptoms occurred in a bilateral distribution but had a significant degree of asymmetry. The term suggests that the patient has a focal epilepsy. The modifier generalized is used when the manifestations occur in a relatively widespread distribution and there is approximately equal involvement of both sides and of the distal and proximal segments. The modifier "axial" is used when the manifestations involve predominantly the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the extremities. Usually patients who have axial or generalized seizures have generalized epilepsy. However, some patients with focal epilepsy may have axial or generalized seizures and, vice versa, patients with generalized epilepsies may have seizures that include significant focal elements.
