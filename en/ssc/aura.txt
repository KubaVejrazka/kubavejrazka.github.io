#h Aura
Auras consist exclusively of subjective symptoms and are described by the patient when they ocure or recalled after the end of the seizure.

Auras consist exclusively of subjective symptoms and usually occur at the beginning of a seizure as "warning symptoms" and produce no objective signs other than an occasional altered behavior by the patient to an "unexpected" experience. In general, they are brief (seconds) and only rarely may persist longer (minutes). They may occur in isolation from any other ictal symptom and, if so, tend to last slightly longer. In general, the epileptic nature of auralike symptomatology can be documented objectively only if the aura consistently evolves into a dialeptic or motor seizure or if EEG monitoring demonstrates an EEG seizure pattern during the aura. The aura type may in many cases help to localize the epileptogenic zone. In the SSC, auras are subdivided into the subgroups. If the aura description does not enable to assign it to specific subgroup the term "aura" should be used.
