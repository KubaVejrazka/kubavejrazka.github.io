#h Dialeptic seizure
Disturbance of consciousness and at least partial amnesia for seizure is the dominant part of seizure. It is not related to any type of ictal or interictal EEG finding.

Dialeptic seizures is a new term coined to identify seizures in which the predominant symptomatology consists of an alteration of consciousness when the patient does not respond to external stimuli or such response is partially impaired. Alteration of consciousness is difficult to define. However, for the purpose of identifying dialeptic seizures, altered consciousness is defined as episodes of unresponsiveness or decreased responsiveness that are not caused by motor alterations. Dialeptic seizures are associated with complete or at least partial amnesia for the episode; therefore, amnesia of the episode is necessary to establish the diagnosis of dialeptic seizure. The seizure is not classified as dialeptic if the patient does not respond due to intensive aura or aphasia and he recalls the seizure course. The motor activity when present during dialeptic seizure should not be prominent and consists usually of mild eye-lid or perioral myoclonias.
