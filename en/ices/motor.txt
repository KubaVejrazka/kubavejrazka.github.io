#h Simple partial seizures with motor signs
Any portion of the body may be involved in focal seizure activity depending on the site of origin of the attack in the motor strip. Focal motor seizures may remain strictly focal or they may spread to contiguous cortical areas producing a sequential involvement of bodyparts in an epileptic "march." The seizure is then known as a Jacksonian seizure. Consciousness is usually preserved; however,the discharge may spread to those structures whose participation is likely to result in loss of consciousness and generalized convulsive movements. Other focal motor attacks may be versive with head turning to one side, usually contraversive to the discharge. If speech is involved, this is either in the form of speech arrest or occasionally vocalization. Occasionally a partial dysphasia is seen in the form of epileptic palilalia with involuntary repetition of a syllable or phrase. Following focal seizure activity, there may be a localized paralysis in the previously involved region. This is known as Todd's paralysis and may last from minutes to hours. When focal motor seizure activity is continuous it is known as epilepsia partialis continua.

#u Epilepsia parcialis continua
Under this name have been described cases of simple partial seizures with focal motor signs without a march, usually consisting of clonic spasms, which remain confined to the part of the body in which they originate, but which persist with little or no intermission for hours or days at a stretch. Consciousness is usually preserved, but postictal weakness is frequently evident.
