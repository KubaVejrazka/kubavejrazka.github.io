#h Unclassified epileptic seizures
This category includes all seizures that cannot be classified because of inadequate or incomplete data and includes some seizures that by their natures defy classification in some of other defined broad categories. Many seizures occurring in the infants (e.g., rhythmic eye movements, chewing, swimming movements, jittering, and apnea) will be classified here.
