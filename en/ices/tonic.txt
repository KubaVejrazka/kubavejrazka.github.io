#h Tonic seizures
According to Gowers, a tonic seizure is “a rigid, violent muscle contraction, fixing the limbs in some strained position. There is usually deviation of the eyes and of the head toward one side, and this may amount to rotation involving the whole body, sometimes actually causing the patient to turn around, even two or three times. The features are distorted; the color of the face, unchanged at first, rapidly becomes pale and then flushed and ultimately livid as the fixation of the chest by the spasms stops the movement of respiration. The eyes are open or closed; the conjunctiva is insensitive; the pupils dilate widely as cyanosis comes on. As the spasm continues, it commonly changes its relative intensity in different parts, causing slight alterations in the position of the limbs.”Tonic axial seizures with extension of head, neck, and trunk may also occur.
