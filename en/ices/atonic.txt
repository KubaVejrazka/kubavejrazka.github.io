#h Atonic seizures (astatic)
A sudden diminution in muscle tone occurs which may be fragmentary, leading to head drop with slackening of the jaw, the dropping of a limb or a loss of all muscle tone leading to a slumping to the ground. When these attacks are extremely brief they are known as “drop attacks”. If consciousness is lost, this loss is extremely brief. The sudden loss of postural tone in the head and trunk may lead to injury by projecting objects. The face is particularly subject to injury. In the case of more prolonged atonic attacks, the slumping may be progressive in a rhythmic, successive relaxation manner. So-called drop attacks may be seen in conditions other than epilepsy, such as brain stem ischemia and narcolepsy cataplexy syndrome.
