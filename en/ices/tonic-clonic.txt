#h Tonic-clonic seizures
They are the most frequently encountred of the generalized seizures, often also known as grand mal. Some patients experience a vague ill-described warning, but the majority lose consciousness without any premonitory symptoms. There is a sudden sharp tonic contraction of muscles, and when this involves the respiratory muscles there is stridor, a cry or moan, and the patient falls to the ground in the tonic state, occasionally injuring himself in falling. He lies rigid, and during this stage tonic contraction inhibits respiration and cyanosis may occur. The tongue may be bitten and urine may be passed involuntarily. This tonic stage then gives way to clonic convulsive movements lasting for a variable period of time. During this stage small gusts of grunting respiration may occur between the convulsive movements, but usually the patient remains cyanotic and saliva may froth form the mouth. At the end of this stage, deep respiration occurs and all the muscles relax, after which the patient remains unconscious for a variable period of time and often awakes feeling stiff and sore all over. He then frequently goes into a deep sleep and when he awakens feels quite well apart from soreness and frequently headache. Very short attacks without postictal drowsiness may occur on occasion.
