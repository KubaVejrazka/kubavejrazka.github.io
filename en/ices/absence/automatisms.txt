#h Absence seizures with automatisms
Purposeful or quasipurposeful movements occurring in the absence of awareness during an absence attack are frequent and may range from lip licking and swallowing to clothes fumbling and aimless walking. If spoken to the patient may grunt or turn to the spoken voice and when touched or tickled may rub the site. Automatisms are quite elaborate and may consist of combinations of the above-described movements or may be so simple as to be missed by casual observation. Mixed forms of absence frequently occur.
