#h Generalized seizures
Generalized seizures are those in which the first clinical changes indicate initial involvement of both hemispheres.Consciousness may be impaired and this impairment may be the initial manifestation. Motor manifestations are bilateral. The ictal electroencephalographic patterns initially are bilateral, and presumably reflect neuronal discharge which is widespread in both hemispheres.
