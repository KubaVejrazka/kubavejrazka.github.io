  "distribList": "Left\nRight\nFor seizures involving a distinct somatotopic region, the somatotopic area is specified by simply naming the region itself. (Example: left arm, right foot, etc.)\nBilateral asymmetric\nGeneralized\nAxial",
  "distribNote": "Note: Bilateral asymmetric means that the symptoms occurred in a bilateral distribution but had a significant degree of asymmetry. The term suggests that the patient has a focal epilepsy. The modifier generalized is used when the manifestations occur in a relatively widespread distribution and there is approximately equal involvement of both sides and of the distal and proximal segments. The modifier \"axial\" is used when the manifestations involve predominantly the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the extremities. Usually patients who have axial or generalized seizures have generalized epilepsy. However, some patients with focal epilepsy may have axial or generalized seizures and, vice versa, patients with generalized epilepsies may have seizures that include significant focal elements.",

  "epileptic": "Epileptic seizure",
  "epilepticTitle": "Epileptic seizure (non-classified)",
  "epilepticDesc": "The term is to be used exceptionally when the event is of epileptic origin and cannot be further specified.",

  "paroxysmal": "Paroxysmal event",
  "paroxysmalDesc": "Paroxysmal events are episodes in which the observer believes that there is not sufficient evidence to assume that a “seizure-like” event was of epileptic nature.\n\nIf an “ictal” EEG is available, it should not show an ictal EEG pattern. This classification of epileptic seizures is based exclusively on semiology. However, the EEG can be used to determine whether an episode is epileptic or not. Episodes for which there is not sufficient proof of epileptic nature are classified merely as paroxysmal events.\n\nPsychogenic non-epileptic seizures may express typical signs:",
  "paroxysmalList": "Longer duration, often longer than ten minutes.\nSituation-related.\nAsynchronneous, irregular jerks lacking typical evolution.\nNon stereotyped.\nNo posturing.\nPreserved response to stimuli while consciousness is grossly impaired. Eyes closed, active resistance with passive opening.\nNot originating from sleep, hower may start from pseudosleep.",

  "autonomic": "Autonomic seizure",
  "autonomicDesc": "Autonomic seizures consist of episodic alterations of autonomic function that are elicited by epileptic activation of autonomic cortical centers.\n\nAutonomic seizures are quite rare type of seizure, usually with obvious ictal EEG pattern. Cases in which the patient reports only sensations that most probably correspond to an autonomic alteration (hot flashes, palpitations, and so on) and for which there is no objective documentation should be classified as autonomic auras (described above). To make the diagnosis of an autonomic seizure, episodes of autonomic dysfunction must be documented by appropriate polygraphic recording (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and so on) or by direct observation. Documented episodes of autonomic dysfunction may be clinically silent (i.e., the episodes may only be detected by a monitor, without the patient experiencing any unusual symptoms). Tachycardia is frequently detected at the onset or in the course of epileptic seizures, so it may even be used as a paramater for automatic seizure detection. In most cases tachycardia reflects emotional response of patient to the seizure onset; patient may produce tachycardia, mydriasis and sweating in a response to unpleasant psychic aura or just to the recognized seizure onset.\n\nSomatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:",

  "auraDesc": "Auras consist exclusively of subjective symptoms and are described by the patient when they ocure or recalled after the end of the seizure.\n\nAuras consist exclusively of subjective symptoms and usually occur at the beginning of a seizure as \"warning symptoms\" and produce no objective signs other than an occasional altered behavior by the patient to an \"unexpected\" experience. In general, they are brief (seconds) and only rarely may persist longer (minutes). They may occur in isolation from any other ictal symptom and, if so, tend to last slightly longer. In general, the epileptic nature of auralike symptomatology can be documented objectively only if the aura consistently evolves into a dialeptic or motor seizure or if EEG monitoring demonstrates an EEG seizure pattern during the aura. The aura type may in many cases help to localize the epileptogenic zone. In the SSC, auras are subdivided into the subgroups. If the aura description does not enable to assign it to specific subgroup the term \"aura\" should be used.",

  "somatosensory": "Somatosensory aura",
  "somatosensoryDesc": "Somatosensory auras consist of abnormal somatosensory sensations (\"paresthesias\") that are limited to a clearly defined region of the body.\n\nUsually are described as tingling or \"pins and needles\". Sensations that are poorly localized or consist of vague sensations should be classified as unclassifiable auras (just \"auras\"). Somatosensory auras  are the result of epileptic activation of somatosensory cortex (S I - Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3). The change in aura localization reflects the spread of seizure activity in somatosensory cortex. Supplementary sensorimotor or secondary somatosensory area activation (S II) may produce extensive and also bilateral paresthesia, or even pain.",

  "visual": "Visual aura",
  "visualDesc": "Visual hallucinations or illusions, when occurring in isolation, should be classified as visual auras.\n\nVisual auras are usually described as \"flashes\" or \"black spots\" in one half of the visual field, however sometimes may be reported just in the center of visual field. Ictal blindness may reflex the visual aura or may ocure as post-ictal symptom. More elaborate visual hallucinations or illusions that are associated with other complex distortions of perception (such as alterations of the sense of familiarity of what the patient is seeing or hearing, complex visual or auditory illusions, or the hearing of voices, and so on), should be classified as visual auras only if the visual hallucination or illusion is clearly the predominant symptom, at least for a significant part of the aura. Otherwise, they should be classified as psychic auras. Poorly defined alterations of vision (such as \"blurry vision\") should be designated unclassifiable auras. Visual auras are the result of epileptic activation of visual cortex (primary, V I - Brodmann area 17) or surrounding cortex (secondary, V II - Brodmann areas 18,19).",

  "auditory": "Auditory aura",
  "auditoryDesc": "Auditory auras are auditory hallucinations or illusions and usually are described as different tones or noises. More elaborated auditory hallucinations or illusions that occur together with complex alterations of perception (such as alterations of the sense of familiarity of what the patient is seeing or hearing, visual or auditory illusions, or the simultaneous occurrence of complex visual hallucinations, and so on) should be classified as auditory auras only if the auditory hallucination or illusion is clearly the predominant symptom. Otherwise, these complex auras should be classified as psychic auras. Auditory auras are the result of epileptic activation of primary auditory cortex close to Heschl gyri (area A I - Brodmann areas 41, 42). More complex auditory hallucinations as voices or melodies are attributed to the activation of temporal association neocortex (secondary auditory area A II - Brodmann area 22).\n\nSomatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:",

  "olfactory": "Olfactory aura",
  "olfactoryDesc": "Perception of a smell as an epileptic phenomenon is classified as an olfactory aura.\n\nOlfactory auras are not so common. They are usually described as a strange unpleasant smell - uncinate crisis. At times, like auditory and visual hallucinations and illusions, they are associated with other complex alterations of perception. These complex alterations of perception should be classified as psychic auras unless the olfactory aura is clearly the predominant feature. Olfactory aura is probably the result of epileptic activation close to gyrus rectus.",

  "gustatory": "Gustatory aura",
  "gustatoryDesc": "Perception of a taste as an epileptic phenomenon is classified as a gustatory aura.\n\nGustatory auras are usually described as a taste that is difficult to describe and may be unpleasant. These auras also tend to be associated with complex perceptual alterations. The term gustatory aura should be applied only when the gustatory hallucination is the predominant symptom. Gustatory aura is probably the result of epileptic activation in posterior part of the insula.",

  "autonomicAura": "Autonomic aura",
  "autonomicAuraDesc": "Autonomic alterations elicited by epileptic activation of autonomic cortical centers produce symptoms that the patient can detect but that observers have difficulty identifying.\n\nAutonomic alterations produce symptoms that the patient can detect but that observers have difficulty identifying, particularly from a videotape recording (palpitations, hot flashes, and so on). Sensations that most probably are an expression of an epileptic autonomic alteration are classified as autonomic auras even when there is no objective proof of their autonomic pathogenesis (such as palpitations or hot flashes). In contrast, autonomic alterations appropriately documented by polygraphic recordings (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and so on) or direct visual observation (mydriasis, sweating, flushing, piloerection, and so on) are classified as autonomic seizures. Isolated autonomic alterations may result from epileptic activation of frontobasal cortex or anterior part of cingulate gyrus.",

  "abdominal": "Abdominal aura",
  "abdominalDesc": "Epigastric sensation is the dominant part of aura.\n\nAbdominal aura is usually described by the patient as unpleasant rising sensation at the stomach area (epigastrium). They often occur in association with other autonomic symptoms, e.g. nausea, etc. Some of these symptoms are probably the expression of increased abdominal peristaltic activity and therefore correspond to a subgroup of autonomic auras (or autonomic seizures, if the alteration of peristalsis has been documented). In other cases, they may be caused by epileptic activation of viscero-abdominal cortical areas. Independent of the pathogenesis abdominal auras are closely related to temporal lobe epilepsy; therefore, it appears useful to classify them independently as abdominal auras.",

  "psychic": "Psychic aura",
  "psychicDesc": "Psychic auras consist of complex hallucinations and illusions that usually affect different senses.\n\nThe most typical examples are distortions of familiarity, such as sensations of déja vu or jamais vu. Frequently these sensations may be associated with emotional alterations, such as fear. In addition, they may occur together with complex visual, auditory or other hallucinations and illusions, including visual hallucinations such as macropsia, micropsia, and so on. Psychic auras result probably from the activation of temporal association neocortex.",

  "dialeptic": "Dialeptic seizure",
  "dialepticDesc": "Disturbance of consciousness and at least partial amnesia for seizure is the dominant part of seizure. It is not related to any type of ictal or interictal EEG finding.\n\nDialeptic seizures is a new term coined to identify seizures in which the predominant symptomatology consists of an alteration of consciousness when the patient does not respond to external stimuli or such response is partially impaired. Alteration of consciousness is difficult to define. However, for the purpose of identifying dialeptic seizures, altered consciousness is defined as episodes of unresponsiveness or decreased responsiveness that are not caused by motor alterations. Dialeptic seizures are associated with complete or at least partial amnesia for the episode; therefore, amnesia of the episode is necessary to establish the diagnosis of dialeptic seizure. The seizure is not classified as dialeptic if the patient does not respond due to intensive aura or aphasia and he recalls the seizure course. The motor activity when present during dialeptic seizure should not be prominent and consists usually of mild eye-lid or perioral myoclonias.\n\nUse the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:",

  "typicalDialeptic": "Typical dialeptic seizure",
  "typicalDialepticDesc": "Typical dialeptic seizures consist of short episodes of altered consciousness: <20 s. The alteration of consciousness begins and ends abruptly and frequently is associated with rhythmical eye blinking at a rate of ~ 3 Hz.\n\nPatients with generalized absence epilepsy often have typical dialeptic seizures. All seizures that consist mainly of an alteration of consciousness but that are not “typical dialeptic seizures” should be classified as just dialeptic seizures.",

  "special": "Special seizure",
  "specialDesc": "Seizures that cannot be classified in one of the four types described above are classified as special seizures.\n\nAll these seizures are \"negative\" or \"inhibitory\" motor seizures except the aphasic seizures that most probably represent \"negative cognitive\" seizures.",

  "atonic": "Atonic seizure",
  "atonicDesc": "Atonic seizures cause a loss of postural tone which may affect the head, the whole body or part of the body.\n\nhe result is loss of posture (head drops, falls, and so on). Often these seizures are preceded by a short myoclonic seizure causing propulsion or retropulsion of the body and patients then suffer more injuries due to their falls compared to simple atonic falls. Atonic seizures are usually generalized, however focal atonic seizures with involvement of only part of the body were also described as \"ictal paresis\" or \"inhibitory seizure\". Atonic seizures probably reset from epileptic activition of cortical negative motor area or form activation of inhibitory centers in brainstem; e.g. gigantocellular nucleus\n\nSomatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:",

  "astatic": "Astatic seizure",
  "astaticDesc": "Astatic seizures consist of epileptic falls.\n\nEpileptic falls may result from atonic, tonic or myoclonic seizure. Polygraphic studies show that only in a few patients are the falls the result of atonic seizures. In most patients, a myoclonic jerk causes the patient to lose balance, and the fall itself is produced by an atonia that occurs immediately after the initial myoclonic jerk. Pure generalized tonic seizures may also lead to an epileptic fall. In most patients, however, no video-polygraphic studies are performed and the pathogenesis of the fall is uncertain. It seems useful to classify astatic seizures separately because of the variable pathogenesis of the falls, which usually remains undefined.",

  "hypomotor": "Hypomotor seizure",
  "hypomotorDesc": "Hypomotor seizures have as their main manifestation a decrease or total absence of motor activity without the emergence of new motor manifestations. This classification is used exclusively in patients in whom it is not possible to test consciousness during or after the seizure (such as newborns, infants, and severely mentally retarded patients).\n\nIn many patients, consciousness is probably altered during the seizures even if by definition consciousness cannot be tested directly. In a few patients with hypomotor seizures, the pathogenesis of the seizures may be different; consciousness may be preserved, and the absence of movement may be an expression of an akinetic seizure or may be a reaction to an aura.\n\nUse the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:",

  "akinetic": "Akinetic seizure",
  "akineticDesc": "Akinetic seizures are characterized by the inability to perform voluntary movements while consciousness is fully preserved.\n\nThey can actually be considered negative complex motor seizures. Muscle tone is also frequently lost, but the akinesia is the most prominent manifestation of the seizure. These seizures are most probably an expression of the activation of the negative motor areas in the mesial frontal and inferior frontal gyri. Only patients in whom consciousness is preserved during the seizures can have akinetic seizures because they can be tested or tell about the \"akinetic\" symptoms.\n\nSomatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:",

  "negativeMyoclonic": "Negative myoclonic seizure",
  "negativeMyoclonicDesc": "Negative myoclonic seizures are seizures that consist of a brief interruption of tonic muscle activity due to an epileptiform discharge.\n\nThe brief interruption of muscle activity may result in a short, sudden movement similar to a myoclonic jerk. However, the pathogenesis of the movement is a brief loss of muscle tone and not a burst of muscle potentials characteristic of myoclonic seizures. Evidence suggests that these seizures are generated by epileptiform discharges in the primary sensorimotor cortex.\n\nSomatotopic localization of the symptoms can be applied:",

  "aphasic": "Aphasic seizure",
  "aphasicDesc": "During aphasic seizures, the patient cannot speak and often cannot understand spoken langure while consciousness is fully preserved.\n\nThe seizures are probably a negative phenomenon produced by epileptic activation of a cortical language centers, a phenomenon similar to that produced by cortical stimulation of language areas (Broca's - Brodmann areas 44,45 and Wernicke's - Brodmann area 22).\n\nUse the following somatotopic or lateralizing modifiers to characterize the seizure:",
